# so ya Some browsers block JavaScript features for local files, so using a local server is better.
> If you have Python installed: Open your terminal/command prompt. Navigate to your project folder: cd ur files


# > Start a server:
# Python 3:
> python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2:
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Open your browser and go to: 
> http://localhost:8000
